  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Description: </strong>This program is a ‘choose-your-own-adventure’ journey through the eyes of an artist.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Purpose: </strong>Our goal with this program is to inform the user of the many careers available in the creative field.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Audience: </strong>Our target audience is anyone interested and passionate about art. It allows them to see the opportunities they could take and gives them plenty of information based on their choices.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Inspiration: </strong>We inspired ourselves to create this program. We are all interested in artwork and thought it would be great to create a program that is both entertaining and a helpful way to pinpoint the user’s interests. Once their interested are discovered, the program displays information about the careers that their path lead to.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Tech Stack: </strong>We made our program using Python and used Azure and Jupyter as our main interface.
</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Challenges: </strong>We had some difficulty when working with Jupyter’s unstable platform. Normally, we would work in IDLE, another python programming interface, but it was not installed on the computers we used. This caused us to deal with Azure’s unstable coding environment, leading us to lose portions of work at times.
</li>
  <div class="list-group-item"><strong>Future Plans: </strong>We could improve our program by fully bullet-proofing it and avoiding any errors that could be caused by the user typing in the wrong thing into the input statements, throughout the program. Some future changes we could add to our program is…
  <li class="ml-5">Bullet-proof the program entirely with specific checks.</li>
  <li class="ml-5">Add more branches and choices in the adventure.</li>
  <li class="ml-5">Add more endings with more information about new careers in the art field.</li>
