  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Description: </strong>This translator will translate Python syntax in Java syntax. Allowing programmers to use their prior knowledge of a language and apply that knowledge to another.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Purpose: </strong>We are trying to accomplish an easy way for a programmer to look up syntax and their equivalents in a handy dictionary. </li>
  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Audience: </strong>Our target audience are programmers who want to broaden their knowledge on different programming languages.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Inspiration: </strong>We inspired by our own struggles in remembering syntax. Our initial idea was to create a program to give definitions to any syntax in any language, all in one place. We then decided to take it a step further and create a translator between programming languages.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Tech Stack: </strong>Our main programming language is Python. We used websites such as Azure Notebooks and Jupyter to interpret our code.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Challenges: </strong>Jupyter is a very unstable platform which makes it difficult to write code, and test. We were forced to use this platform because the classroom in which or meeting are held do not have python IDLE downloaded to the computers. This means we were forced to use a websiteâ€™s interpreter.</li>
  <div class="list-group-item"><strong>Future Plans: </strong>Some of the future changes we plan to do to improve the translator are:
    <li class="ml-5">Include more complex syntax for python and Java</li>
    <li class="ml-5">Add more computer languages to translate</li>
    <li class="ml-5">Make a website or an app</li>
